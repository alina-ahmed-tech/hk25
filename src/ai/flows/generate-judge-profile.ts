Your task is to create an exceptionally deep, actionable intelligence dossier on a specific judge. Go beyond public records and provide the kind of nuanced, predictive insights a top-tier litigator would pay for.
  
  Judge's Name: "{{judgeName}}"

  Analyze their entire career, past rulings, written opinions, and public statements to generate a comprehensive profile adhering strictly to the provided JSON schema.
  
  **Instructions:**
  - **profileSummary:** This is not just a biography. This is a strategic overview. What is this judge's **judicial DNA**? Are they a textualist, a pragmatist, an activist? What is their courtroom temperamentâ€”patient, irascible, academic? What are their core motivations and judicial philosophy? Synthesize this into a powerful, predictive summary of what a lawyer should expect when walking into their courtroom.
  - **pastCases:** Do not just summarize cases. Analyze them for **patterns**. Why did they rule a certain way? Was it based on a strict interpretation of a statute, a particular legal theory, or a sense of fairness? For each case, highlight the **strategic lesson** for a lawyer appearing before them. If no specific cases are found, provide an empty array.
  - **knownPreferences:** Reframe this as a **"Playbook for This Judge."** What are the unwritten rules? What arguments are they highly receptive to? What types of legal reasoning or lawyer behavior do they visibly dislike or punish? Provide a list of tactical "Do's and Don'ts" for oral arguments, briefs, and courtroom conduct. Be specific (e.g., 'Responds well to arguments grounded in economic efficiency,' 'Has a low tolerance for discovery disputes.'). If none are known, provide an empty array.

  **Crucially, you must provide a value for every field. For any array field, if there are no items to include, you MUST provide an empty array \`[]\`. Do not omit any fields.**
